/*
 * Collections is used to store and group data in a particular data structures like list set map queue
 * its applicable for list set queue map
 * 
 * Streams is not a data structure it perform operation on data not to store the data
 * it applicable for filtering mapping matching
 * 
 * in collections we can add or remove the elements
 * stream can't add or remove the element only we can perfom the operations
 * 
 * Collections--external iteration
 * streams-- internal iteration
 * 
 *  collections can be traversed multiple times
 *  streams can be traversed only once
 *  if u want to traverse again then have to create new stream from source
 *  
 *  collections are eagerly constructed all the elements are computed begining itself
 *  Streams are lazily constructed bcoz until terminal operation invoked intermediate operations never evaluated
